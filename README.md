# TH Guest computer
This repository contains all files needed to set up/customize the guest computer at [Schloss Tempelhof](https://www.schloss-tempelhof.de/).

The guest user will be freshly created on every boot and deleted on every shut down to prevent leaving poersonal information. The user account gets customized.

## Usage
### Preparation
1. Install a current Ubuntu LTS Desktop edition (as time of writing: Ubuntu 18.04.3)
  1. Follow graphical installer to set hostname, timezone, etc according to your needs
  2. Create an administrative user `administrator` during installation
    *Note:* if you want to choose a different user name, you have to rename the file `var/lib/AccountsService/users/administrator` accordingly.
2. install additional software on the computer: `sudo apt-get install gimp gimp-help-de brasero vcdimager gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad nautilus-image-converter vlc libdvdcss2`

### Provisioning
*Note:* As only a single computer is used, the process was not automted by. e.g. [Ansible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)), but doing so should be trivial.
1. Clone the repository
2. Change the password of the guest user in file `/usr/local/sbin/add-guest-user.sh`
   *Note:* If you additionally want to change the username, do so in following files:
  1. `/usr/local/sbin/add-guest-user.sh`
  2. `/usr/local/sbin/delete-guest-user.sh`
  3. `/usr/local/sbin/daily-shutdown.sh`
  4. `/etc/polkit-1/localauthority/20-org.d/de.schloss_tempelhof.disable_hibernate.pkla`
  5. `/etc/polkit-1/localauthority/20-org.d/de.schloss_tempelhof.disable_suspend.pkla`
  6. `/etc/polkit-1/localauthority/20-org.d/de.schloss_tempelhof.disable_lock_sessions.pkla`
3. Copy the files over to their final destionation on the guest computer
   *Note:* If the file already exists (e.g. `/etc/crontab`) add its content to the existing file.
   *Note:* Double check that file permissions fit.

## Features
